    "The idea behind RNN models is that each new element in the sequence contributes new information, which updates the current state of the model. The intuition if close to our commplace understanding of how we process sequential information in our day-to-day. Our memory is not cleared upon arriving at new information - rather, our memory is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental building block often used for modeling sequential patterns via machine learning is the Markov chain model. In a general sense, we can view our data sequences as \"chains\", with each node in the chain dependent in some way on the previous node, in effect carrying forward the history of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN models are also based on this notion of a chain. Types of RNNs vary in how they maintain and update information. RNNs apply some form of loop where an input $x_t$ (perhaps a word in a sequence) is observed at time $t$, and the network updates its \"state vector\" to $h_t$ from the previous vector $h_{t-1}$. Then the subsequent update will be dependent on $h_t$, which in effect retains the history of the sequence up to that point. This can be thought of as one long unrolled chain, where link in the chain involved the same kind of processing step based on the history understood up to that point in the chain.\n",

The high-dimensional one-hot vectors are embedded into a number vector space with much lower dimensionality. A popular implementation of this word2vec, will be explored in chapter 6.\n",

A popular method is the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. It differs from our basic RNN by having some special memory mechanisms that enable the recurrent cells to better store information for long period of time. This captures long-term dependencies better than basic RNNs.\n",

These parameters filter the information that is 'worth remembering' and passing forward from the information that is worth 'forgetting'.\n",

We also give dynamic_rnn() the length of each sequence through the variable seqlens. This allows TensorFlow to stop all RNN steps once the last 'real' element is reached in each sample, which effectively ignores the PAD elements. It also returns all output vectors over time. These appear in the outputs tensor, and are zero-padded beyond the end of the true sequence."
