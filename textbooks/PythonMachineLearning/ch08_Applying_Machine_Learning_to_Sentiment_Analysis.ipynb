It is a generatie probabilistic model that attempts to fid groups of words that appear together across different documents. The frequently appearing words represent topics, under the assumption that each document is a mixture of different words. The input is a bag-of-words model. The output are two new matrices - a document to topic matrix and a word to topic matrix. LDA decomposes the bag-of-words input matrix in a way where multiplying the two output matrices together would reproduce the input matrix with the lowext possible error.
