As a result, if $\\lvert w\\rvert$ < 1, this factor becomes very small when $t-k$ is large. On the other hand, if $\\lvert w\\rvert$ > 1, then $w^{t-k}$ becomes very large when $t-k$ is large.

    "The data prep stage above created same-length sequences where the elements are integers that correspond to the indices of unique words. Now we need to convert this to input features. The wrong way to do it would be to apply on-ehot encoding to convert indices into ectors of zeros and ones. Each word would be mapped to a vector with a size equal to the number of unique words in the dataset. This is less than ideal, because the number of unique words can rise to the tens of thousands. A model trained on features like this may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Further, these features would be very sparse, since all values are zero except one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach would be to map each word to a vector of fixed size with real-valued elements (not integers necessarily). With this approach, we can instead use finite-sized vector to represent and infinite number of real number. This is the idea behind the embedding, which is a feature-learning technique that can be utilized to automatically learn the salient features in the data. Given the value of a parameter unique_words, we can choose the size of the embedding vectors to be much smaller than the number of unique words in the corpus. The advantages of emebedding over one-hot encoding for these problems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A reduction in dimensionality decreases the effect of the curse of dimensionality\n",
    "2. The extraction of salient features since the embedding layer in a neural network is trainable\n",

We create a matrix of size $[n\\_words \\times embedding\\_size]$ as a tensor variable with randomly initialized values between [-1,1]. then we use tf.nn.embedding_lookup to loo up the row in the embedding matrix associated with each element of tf_x:"

    "In the build method, we create three placeholder for the input, output, and dropout keep-probability. Then we add the embedding layer, which builds the embedded representation of the unique words. Next within the build method, we built the RNN network. This was done in three steps.\n",

    "1. Define multilayer RNN cells\n",
    "2. Define initial state of these cells\n",
    "3. Create and RNN specified by the RNN cells in their initial states\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps are unpacked in further detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 1: Define multilayer RNN cells__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to define the multilayer RNN cells, which was accomplished using a TensorFlow wrapper ckass to define the LSTM cells - BasicLSTMCell. These can be stacked together to form a multilayer RNN using the MultiRNNCell wrapper class. The process of stacking RNN cells with a dropout stage has three nested steps. Described from the inside out:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create RNN cells using tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell\n",
    "2. Apply dropout to the RNN cells using tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper\n",
    "3. Make a list of such cells according to the desired number of RNN layer and pass this list to tf.contrib.rnn.MultiRNNCell\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is completed using a list comprehension in the implementation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2: defining the initiatl states for the RNN cells__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the architecture of LSTM cells, there are three types of inputs - input data $\\textbf{x}^t$, activations of hidden units from the previous time step $\\textbf{x}^{t-1}$, and the cell state of the previous time step $\\textbf{C}^{t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above implementation $\\textbf{x}^t$ is the embedded embed_x data tensor. We also need to specify the previous state of the cells. If we're starting a new input sequence, we initialize the cell state to a zero state, then for each seubsequent time step we need to store the updated state of the cells to use in the following time step. The initial state in the implementation above is set by calling cells.zero_state\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 3: Creating the RNN using the RNN cells and their states__\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step of the RNN creation process used the tf.nn.dynamic_rnn function to pull all of the components together. This function pulls the embedded data, the RNN cells and their initial states, and creates a pipeline for them according to the unrolled architecture of the LSTM cells. It returns a tuple containing the activations of the RNN cells called outputs, as well as their final states in a variable called state. The output is a 3D tensor with the shape [batch size \\times num_steps \\times lstm_size]. We pass the variables outputs to a fully connected layer to get logits and then store the final state so that we can use this as the initial state for the next mini-batch of data. Lastly, once the components of the RNN are setup, the cost function and optimization method is defined in a fashion similar to other networks that we have implemented\n"

    "\n",
    "In our implementation, at the beginning of each epoch we start from the zero states of the RNN cells as the current state. The process of running each mini-batch of data is performed by feeding the current state with the batch_x data and the corresponding labels in batch_y. After finishing the process for a mini-batch, we update the state to be the final state, which is returned by the tf.nn.dynamic_rnn function. This updated state will be used in the execution of the next mini-batch. This process is repeated for each mini-batch, and the current state is updated through the epoch."
